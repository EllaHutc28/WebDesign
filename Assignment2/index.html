<h3> Chapter 3</h3>
<p> Galahad then steps into Eggsy's life, in which he reads Eggsy instantly. He tests his composure, intelligence, and instincts. Galahad also reveals what the "Kingsman" really are for, that they aren't just cool and fancy spies, but serious agents who constantly teeter between the line of life and death. Eggsy's pride and ego is challenged, realizing he isn't the only talented person there and that his raw skill isn't enough.</p>

<h3> Chapter 4</h3>
<p> After these tests, Eggsy is offered a place into the Kingsman. Although not a tradtional offer, he is thrown "straight to the wolves" and has to thrive in a new world he hasn't seen before. Navigating between a world of new rules, and hidden violence. This is where Eggsy shows his first real signs of a goal. He's still suspicious and exhibiting defense behaviors, but he is now aiming for something higher than just surviving.</p>
