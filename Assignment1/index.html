<h1>Kingsman</h1>


<h2>By Matthew Vaughn</h2>


<h3>Why Kingsman has the best action</h3>
I like Kingsman because the action isnt too cheesy in comparison to older spy movies, but it plays perfectly into the stereotype of spy movies, while making it actually enjoyable. The fight scenes are planned to not only keep you as engaged as possible, but also look as good as it possibly can. The fight scenes also flow really well into each other, and at times it almost feels seamless.

<h3>Why the music fits the movie so well</h3>
The music plays well into each scene and keeps you engaged in the story, whether it be an action scene with a very up-tempo and thrilling score, or a sad scene where the music pulls at your heart-strings bringing you to tears. The music in this movie is also very well thought out much like the action, and adds so much to the movie.

<h3>Why Merlin is the best character in Kingsman</h3>
I also really like the characters and the way they are written. In particular I really like Merlin, because he is always there when you need him, but will also call you out on your issues and help you work through them. He's originally just a regular side character, but as the movie goes on, he starts to have a much bigger role in the story. To a point where if he wasn't involved, none of it would have been possible.
