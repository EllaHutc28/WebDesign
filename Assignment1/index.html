<h1>Kingsman</h1>


<h2>By Matthew Vaughn</h2>


<h3>Why Kingsman is the BEST!</h3>
I like Kingsman because the action isnt too cheesy in comparison to older spy movies, but it plays perfectly into the stereotype of spy movies, while making it actually enjoyable. The music plays well into each scene and keeps you engaged in the story. I also really like the characters and the way they are written. In particular I really like Merlin, because he is always there when you need him, but will also call you out on your issues and help you work through them.
