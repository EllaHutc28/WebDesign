# Kingsman
## By Matthew Vaughn
I like Kingsman because the action isnt too cheesy in comparison to older spy movies, but it plays perfectly into the stereotype of spy movies, while making it actually enjoyable. The ,usic plays well into each scene and keeps you engaged in the story. I also really like the characters and the way they are written.
